# CS50portfolio

readfirst: If you are currently enrolled in the course, you should NOT view my solutions. "Searching for or soliciting outright solutions to problem sets online or elsewhere" is specifically listed as Not Reasonable, as is "Viewing another’s solution to a problem set’s problem and basing your own solution on it" and "Accessing a solution to some problem prior to (re-)submitting your own". Keep in mind that we are taking CS50 to learn, and working through problems on your own (though at times can feel frustrating) will give you a much better understanding of the concepts. If you are stuck, I have found the CS50 subreddit (https://www.reddit.com/r/cs50/) to be very helpful, I suggest going there and reading through the questions from other students, or posting one of your own.

This repository holds my solutions to the problem sets from Introduction to Computer Science (CS50), which I am taking through HarvardX on edX.
